Easy Recycling

I made this mod because I was playing through a modpack and was having trouble handling all the loot drops from custom mob spawners. I didn't want to just drop it all into lava and destroy it, I wanted to keep it and make use of it somehow. This mod is how.

It's EASY, you just make the Recycling Table.

Place it down like a Grindstone.

Then insert any tool or piece of armor. It'll give you an amount of the crafting material proportional to how much of the tool or armor piece is left. (ie: A Diamond Chestplate at 1/2 durability will give you 4 Diamonds.)


FAQ:
Q: I use this in my Modpack?
A: Yes. Just make sure you credit me as the author or link to this page. And I would love to hear about it if you do, just leave a comment below!

Q: Does it support [insert mod here]?
A: Not currently, only vanilla items are supported right now. Mod support for some of the most popular mods will be coming in future updates.

Q: Why can't I hopper items into it?
A: Because it currently isn't a tile entity. It works more like a crafting table than a furnace. I plan to update this in the future so that you can pipe items in and out, but this is just an early version of the mod.

Q: Why isn't [other feature] in this mod?
A: Because I didn't think of it or because I thought it would be too unbalanced/out of the scope of the mod. any suggestions you have, I'd be happy to hear. Just drop a comment below.
